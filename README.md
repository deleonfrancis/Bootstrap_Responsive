## Description

As a Web Developer, there will be times that I'm called to make a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. This project illustrates just that. By using Bootstrap Grid, I was able to make a responsive site layout and with responsive content. Bootstrap was also used to make a Navbar and a sticky footer.

First, I created three html files (index.html, contact.html, and portfolio.html) and linked them into my index.html. Next, I used a bootstrap starter template and created the page layout using Bootstrap Navbar and sticky footer code. In conjunction with some css, I was able to style the page like to provided example. I used https://imagecolorpicker.com/en/ to get as close as possible to the color scheme provided in the example. CSS was further used to style the content in the Navbar and Footer. After creating the Navbar and footer once, I copied and pasted both sections to my contact.html and portfolio.html to keep the content the same on all three pages.

Starting with the About Page, or my index.html, I used semantic elements to start with an h1 called 'About Me'. Next I used the bootstrap grid to create a row and column, link a picture of me with an image tag and formulated two paragraphs about myself in the column. I used the 'float-left and pr-4' Bootstrap property to make the words wrap around the image and give it some padding right.

Moving on the contact.html, I used the same semantic elements to start with an h1 called 'Contact'. Then imported a form and button. On the form, I gave the content a custom label and placeholder name, with a bootstrap 'padding left' for spacing. I used a CSS ID on the submit button to style it like the example.

Finally, on the portfolio.html continued the theme of using semantic elements to start with an h1 called 'Portfolio'. Used Bootstrap Grid to place images on screen and make them responsive.

This project familiarized me with Bootstrap, some @media, CSS, and linking multiple pages. Overall a very good project.
